						<b>INFORMATION</b><hr/><br/>
						What would happen if you crossed How Stuff Works with a game show? Quite likely, you would get something along the lines of ”Junkyard Wars". Racing against the clock, many teams scrap together working machines to carry out a particular mission. At the end of each show, the different teams pit their creations against each other to find out who has put together the best solution to the producers' challenge.<br/>
						To fans of all ages, the formula is an ideal mesh of education and entertainment. The show has the same "real people" appeal of hit reality shows like "Survivor," but contestants compete with pure mental prowess and ingenuity, rather than alliances and plots.
