						<b>INTRODUCTION</b><hr/>
						<br/>
						<ul>
						Books and minds work only when they are open. Education has become more theoretical
						today limiting
						depth and thus failing to create interest of youth in technology. People are
						becoming good users of technology but for becoming someone who develops technology,
						circumstances are no longer favorable!<br/>
						So first time in the history of Prajwalan, we present AABHYANTAR. The main idea behind
						is to promote the importance of practical education. It will serve as a platform for students to
						interact with geeks of our College.<br/>
						It includes exhibitions for computer and mechanical undergraduates.
						We aim to help students increase their basic knowledge of computers and automobiles. The
						exhibition will include practical sessions, handson
						workshops and much more. And thus we
						aim to motivate students to question everything!
						</ul>

						<b>COMPUTER</b><hr/>
						<ul>
						When we have a permanent storage memory like hard disks, flash drives then why we
						require a temporary storage memory like RAM? A computer science graduate can easily
						answer but survey says that 70% students who buy computers don’t event know the
						configuration. They either end up buying a high end computer just to run C, C++ programs
						or they end up buying a notebook PC for graphics simulation and 3D modeling!<br/>
						Aabhyantar aims in helping students understand computers in more depth for those who
						belong to computer science and information technology disciplines whereas to understand
						the importance of computers and their basic functionality for those who belong to mechanical
						or civil or electrical engineering disciplines.<br/>
						Aabhyantar will include the following in this field		
							<li>Understanding peripherals of computers</li>
							<li>PC buying guide</li>
							<li>Basic maintenance and troubleshooting</li>
							<li>Open source software distribution</li>
				    </ul>

						<b>MECHANICAL</b><hr/>
						<UL>
						Did you ever went to buy a bike or car? How “cc” and “mileage” are corelated?
						Do
						you know what DTSi,
						APDV and ATFT stands for? And what is their significance? Why
						diesel engines for bikes are still not in market? Can you imagine the piston in the engine of
							your bike reciprocates 6090
							times in a second even when you are driving your bike in	
							economy speed range!<br/>
							In, Aabhyantar we will help people better understand automobiles and their working. We
							will help them decide which vehicle to choose from when several options are available and
							how to troubleshoot basic problems of vehicles.<br/>
							Aabhyantar will include the following in this field
								<LI>Automobile Components</LI>
								<LI>Engine Assembly and Disassembly</LI>
								<LI>Automobile buying guidance</LI>
								<LI>Bike technology comparison</LI>
